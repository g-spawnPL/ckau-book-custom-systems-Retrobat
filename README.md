## Purpose

EmulationStation displays systems based on a file called es_systems.cfg. In other distributions, this is typically the only file. However, in Batocera FIXME and higher, and in Retrobat 5 and higher, one or more `es_systems_<custom_name>.cfg` files can be used as an overlay to the original `/usr/share/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg` file.

This repository contains .cfg files for adding additional systems to your Batocera or Retrobat installation, all supported by [Ckau Book](https://github.com/CkauNui/ckau-book) theme.

You must use a unique `<custom_name>` field when adding a new system if you wish to keep the old one in addition. However, if using duplicate shortnames is a necessity and you still want the new and old system to exist simultaneously, you can also put both systems in a single CFG file.

Once implemented in your system, you can use our Emulationstation Theme: https://github.com/CkauNui/ckau-book

## How to install new systems

## Retrobat <img align="left" width="30px" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1599404333845680131/EKDxmsad_400x400.jpg">

Additional .cfg files are located in the following directory of this repository:

`/Retrobat/system`

Also for Retrobat, the additional .cfg files must be in the same directory as `es_systems.cfg`.
However, Retrobat install location may vary according to what you have chosen during the installation profile.
Assuming that Retrobat is installed in C:\Retrobat, `es_systems.cfg` directory is located in

`C:\RetroBat\emulationstation\.emulationstation\`

Please replace `C:\Retrobat` with your actual installation path.

When done, for each added system you should create the proper `/roms/<system_name>` directory and put your roms into it.
Please check the right name to create in the `/Retrobat/roms` directory of this repository.

You'll also find a `_info.txt` file that explains which extensions are allowed for each system.
For some systems, there may be also the need to install additional emulators in Retrobat (check the same `_info.txt` file for instructions).
A newly added system, if there is at least one rom file, will automatically be recognized by Retrobat at the next boot.
